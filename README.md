# Process

---

### Initial

-  Goal is to make a CV that is as simple as possible to focus mainly on legibility with lightweight interactibility

### Problems

-  Faced difficulties when making a scroll directed progress bar for components
   -  Initially I made it with recognizing the windowâ€™s scroll and subtracted the origin points to separate + limiting and providing the height of the component
   -  Fixed by properly using forwardRef on child components and framer-motion's useScroll
-  Floating elements - with height as fit-content
   -  Properly fitting the background images without hard values was confusing
      -  Fixed using parent element as position relative!
-  Initially animated the appearance of boxes by using aos library
   -  There was issue with overscroll appearing on mobile
   -  Solved by introducing framer-motion intersection observer

### Lessons

-  Fortified React skills
   -  Particularly on ref management in components
-  Utilized Framer motion to enhance user experience
-  Learnt about intersection observer through aos and framer motion
-  Focused in producing responsive, modifiable and lightweight website
